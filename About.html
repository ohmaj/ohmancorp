		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Because Ohman Automation Corp is a small business, we understand the needs and challenges 
		of your small business. We will treat your business as though it were our own. We have a 
		somewhat unique business method in that we will be your "part-time IT administrator". We may 
		not have our own office in your place of business, but you can picture that as being the case. 
		We bill on an as needed basis, minimum 1/10th of an hour (6 minutes). There are automation 
		opportunites within every business. We specialize in analyzing businesses to identify 
		affordable and cost-justified processes that could benefit from a technology plan. Please take 
		a moment to review an excellent article, published by AT&T Business Circle, describing what 
		we will manage for you:</p>
		<h3>Commitment</h3>
		<p>We promise to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a>Always be honest and sincere.</a></li>
			<li><a>Keep your best interests and business success our first priority.</a></li>
			<li><a>Ensure you understand what service we provided.</a></li>
